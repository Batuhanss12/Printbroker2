Refused to load the script 'https://replit.com/public/js/replit-dev-banner.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' *.ideogram.ai *.replit.com". Note that 'script-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.
